# Website for my favourite character Wowbagger

In the book Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the character Wowbagger is one of the more eccentric ones, and only has one short appearance.
Wowbagger 'the Infinitely Prolonged', as he is introduced, is an alien intelligent lifeform travelling the universe on a very personal quest.
He is described as "a being who became immortal after an accident with a few rubber bands, a liquid lunch, and a particle accelerator. After a period of total boredom, especially on Sunday afternoons, he decided to insult everyone in the entire universe in alphabetical order."

## Wowbagger's character traits
* easily bored due to long lifespan
* comitted to personal quest to insult everyone in the entire universe
* inventive in his methods to achieve this goal
* takes care in his personal appearance (e.g. uses expensive soap for skin care)
